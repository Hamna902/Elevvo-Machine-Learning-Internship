# Elevvo Machine Learning Internship - Task Submissions
## Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Elevvo Machine Learning Internship! This repository contains my complete solutions for all 5 assigned tasks, completed between October 2025. These projects reflect my journey in applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems, including regression, clustering, classification, predictive modeling, and recommendation systems. I have gone beyond the minimum requirement of 4 tasks by completing all 5, including bonus features, demonstrating my commitment and enthusiasm for the internship.
## Tasks Completed
### Task 1: Student Score Prediction

### Objective: 
Developed a regression model to predict student scores based on various features.
### Techniques: 
Linear regression, feature scaling, and model evaluation.
### Key Output: 
Predicted scores with accuracy metrics (e.g., RMSE).

### Task 2: Customer Segmentation

### Objective: 
Performed unsupervised learning to segment customers into distinct groups.
### Techniques: 
K-means clustering, elbow method for optimal clusters, and visualization.
### Key Output: 
Cluster assignments and insights into customer behavior.

### Task 3: 
Forest Cover Type Classification

### Objective: 
Classified forest cover types using a multi-class dataset.
### Techniques: 
Decision trees, Logistic Regression with scaled data, confusion matrix analysis.
### Key Output: 
Classification accuracy (~60-70%) and a saved confusion matrix plot.

### Task 4: Loan Approval Prediction

### Objective: 
Built a predictive model to determine loan approval status.
### Techniques: 
Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SMOTE for class imbalance.
### Key Output: 
Precision and accuracy scores, with bonus model comparison.

### Task 5: Movie Recommendation System

### Objective: 
Created a recommendation system based on user preferences.
### Techniques: 
User-based collaborative filtering, item-based filtering, and matrix factorization (SVD).
### Key Output: 
Top-5 movie recommendations for a sample user with Precision@K evaluation.

## Datasets
The following datasets were used for each task. Due to their large size, they are not included in this repository. Please download them from the provided sources and place them in the appropriate directories to run the notebooks.

### Task 1: Student Performance Dataset
Source: Kaggle (synthetic dataset on student grades, e.g., https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/student-performance).
Format: CSV file with features like study hours, attendance, etc.


### Task 2: Customer Segmentation Dataset
Source: Kaggle (anonymized customer purchase history, e.g., https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).
Format: CSV file with customer demographics and purchase data.


### Task 3: Forest CoverType Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype).
Format: CSV file with 54 features and 7 cover types.


### Task 4: Loan Approval Dataset
Source: Kaggle (synthetic loan application data, e.g., https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset).
Format: CSV file with features like income, credit score, and loan status.


### Task 5: MovieLens 100K Dataset
Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset).
Format: Multiple files (u.data for ratings, u.item for movie details) in the ml-100k folder.


## Setup and Installation
To run the notebooks locally, follow these steps:

```
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Elevvo-ML-Internship.git
cd Elevvo-ML-Internship
```

Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed.
Install required libraries using pip:pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scipy matplotlib imbalanced-learn jupyter


## Run Notebooks:

Launch Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook.
Open each .ipynb file, run all cells, and review outputs.



## Usage

Each notebook is self-contained with code, comments, and results (if saved after execution).
Modify file paths in the code if datasets are stored differently.
For Task 5, ensure the ml-100k folder structure is preserved (e.g., ml-100k/u.data).

Results and Evaluation

Task 1: RMSE or RÂ² scores for regression models.
Task 2: Optimal number of clusters and visualization of segments.
Task 3: Accuracy (~60-70%) and confusion matrix for classification.
Task 4: Precision and accuracy for loan prediction, improved with SMOTE.
Task 5: Top-5 recommendations with Precision@5 (~0.20-0.40) and SVD enhancements.
