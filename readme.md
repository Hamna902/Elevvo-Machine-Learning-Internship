# 🌟 Elevvo Machine Learning Internship - Task Submissions

## 🧩 Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Elevvo Machine Learning Internship**!  
This repository contains my complete solutions for **five assigned tasks**, completed in **October 2025**.  
Each task showcases practical applications of **machine learning** techniques across various domains — including **regression, clustering, classification, predictive modeling**, and **recommendation systems**.

I successfully completed **all 5 tasks**, going beyond the minimum requirement of 4, and implemented **bonus features** in several of them — demonstrating both my **technical depth** and **commitment** to the program.

## 🚀 Tasks Completed

### **Task 1: Student Score Prediction**
**Objective:**  
Developed a regression model to predict student scores based on multiple input features.  

**Techniques Used:**  
Linear Regression, Feature Scaling, Model Evaluation (RMSE & R²).  

**Key Output:**  
Predicted student scores with strong correlation between predicted and actual results.

### **Task 2: Customer Segmentation**
**Objective:**  
Performed unsupervised learning to segment customers into distinct behavioral groups.  

**Techniques Used:**  
K-Means Clustering, Elbow Method, PCA, and Visualization with Matplotlib.  

**Key Output:**  
Cluster assignments providing actionable insights into customer behavior.

### **Task 3: Forest Cover Type Classification**
**Objective:**  
Classified forest cover types using a multi-class dataset.  

**Techniques Used:**  
Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Data Scaling, and Confusion Matrix Analysis.  

**Key Output:**  
Achieved ~65% accuracy with clear class-wise confusion matrix visualization.

### **Task 4: Loan Approval Prediction**
**Objective:**  
Built a predictive model to determine loan approval status based on applicant data.  

**Techniques Used:**  
Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SMOTE for class imbalance, Model Comparison.  

**Key Output:**  
High accuracy and precision, with improved balance after applying SMOTE.

### **Task 5: Movie Recommendation System**
**Objective:**  
Created a personalized recommendation system based on user preferences.  

**Techniques Used:**  
User-based Collaborative Filtering, Item-based Filtering, and Matrix Factorization (SVD).  

**Key Output:**  
Top-5 personalized movie recommendations using Precision@K evaluation.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Elevvo-ML-Internship.git
cd Elevvo-ML-Internship
```

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.
Install required libraries:
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scipy matplotlib imbalanced-learn jupyter
```

3️⃣ Run Notebooks
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
Then open each .ipynb file, run all cells, and review outputs.

---

🧠 Usage

Each notebook is self-contained and includes clear code comments.

Modify file paths in code if your datasets are stored in a different location.

For Task 5, ensure the ml-100k folder structure remains as:

```
ml-100k/
├── u.data
├── u.item
```
